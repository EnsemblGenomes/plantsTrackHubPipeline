# plantsTrackHub
Pipeline that creates Ensembl plant trackhubs given study ids and puts them in the Ensembl Track Hub Registry.

In this pipeline you give as input a set of ENA study ids (study is an ENA RNAseq study with experiments) and it creates a track Hub for every study consisting of Runs and then puts the track Hub in the Ensembl Track Hub Registry.
